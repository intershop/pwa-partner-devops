## Overview

Repository *pwa-partner-devops* provides an *Azure DevOps Pipeline* template, which can be used by PWA projects, that are managed inside *Intershops Commerce Platform* The template should be used as is. Any custom additions should be made outside of the template.

## How to use the pipeline template

To use the pipeline template, add a file named `azure-pipelines.yml` to the root directory of your project with the following content:

```
# azure-pipelines.yml

resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: pwa-partner-devops
      type: github
      endpoint: <GitHub Connection>
      name: intershop/pwa-partner-devops
      ref: refs/heads/stable/v1

jobs:
  - template: ci-job-template.yml@pwa-partner-devops
    parameters:
      <PARAMETER>

```
A more detailed example can be found in the `azure-pipelines.yml.tmpl` file.
After that, in Azure DevOps a new pipeline has to be created from this file.
